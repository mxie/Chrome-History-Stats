This extension was originally made to serve as a code sample for a company I was applying for for a co-op position. It's just a nice and simple project that could be easily extended to do more stuff.

What is it?
- A browser extension for Chrome

What does it do?
- Grabs your browser history from the past 2 weeks and gives you a pie chart that breaks down what sites you visited during the time period.
- If you click on any particular part of the pie chart, a little more detail about your visits to that particular site will be provided (mostly just # of visits).

What tools does it use?
- jQuery
- jQuery UI
- jqPlot

Other features I have in mind:
- Linking back to the actual sites for "faster" navigation
- Further breakdown of what particular parts of the site are being visited
